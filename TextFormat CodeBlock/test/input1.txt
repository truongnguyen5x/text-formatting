The kitchen				 is small, but 				it OK for us. In the kitchen, there is a window. Its curtains are yellow. There is a cooker (UK) / a stove (US) and a washing machine. Opposite there is a fridge and a sink. In the middle, there is a 				white table		 and two white 				chairs. Oh, there are some cupboards, too! for pots and pans, dishes, and so on.	Next to the kitchen, there is a				 sitting-room and a dining-room. On the left, you can see the dining-room. There is a glass 			table				 and four black iron chairs. The			re is a piece of furniture with			 glasses and						 DVDs, and there are some pictures				 on the walls. On the right, you can find the      sitting-room. It has a burgundy sofa and two	 green armchairs. Opposite the 				sofa is the TV set. I go to sleep in front of the TV after lunch! There are some plants and 	there is a big window. This room has a lot of light. I love it.
